# Glossary

- Qubit: A quantum bit that can be in a superposition of 0 and 1.
- Gate: An operation applied to qubits, like X, H, Z, or CX.
- Measurement: The act of reading a qubit, which produces a classical bit.
- Bloch Sphere: A visual representation of a single-qubit state.
- Entanglement: A strong correlation between qubits that has no classical analog.
- QPU: Quantum Processing Unit (real hardware).
- Sampler: A primitive that returns measurement statistics for circuits.
